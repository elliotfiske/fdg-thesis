Hello Elliot,

I am in Zoe's CPE 471 class and I have attempted to answer questions on your website for the last two days. I keep seeing an error message telling me that I am not enrolled in any classes even though I already answered the first question from week 1. Is there any way to fix this?

Thank you,

Hi,

Really sorry about that, I'll look into it right now!

I'll make sure you get credit for the days you couldn't log in.

Thanks,
Elliot

\subsection{Action Taken}
\par This email was in response to a bug where a race condition made it so users' classes occasionally didn't appear. I fixed the bug shortly after receiving that email.
