		After missing all the allowed attempts, it would be nice to know what the answer is so we have a solution to work backwards from. Overall, however, the site was clean and easy to use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \\

		-   There are some UI problems that could be fixed. Certain values like points and commitment weren't consistent from page to page. -   Solving the can't see answers even if actually trying was kind of frustrating.-   I think this might be more useful if there was an app version with a notification each day. I wanted to keep up with Polycommit, but it's pretty easy to forget to check in from day to day.-   Polycommit had one question a day, but the study guide had 70 questions on it. As a result, it wasn't as helpful as I expected it to be because by the time of the exam, I feel like a large portion of the class material didn't show up as a question on polycommit. \\

		When the answers were incorrect or they didn't show the correct answer it really threw off my understanding of the material. I started to question a lot of what I thought I knew, and which ones of the questions were actually correct. This ended up really hurting me on the midterm, because I second guessed myself because of the PolyCommit questions that had been wrong that had not been fixed when I had last looked at them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \\

		I was never reminded to complete problems so I only did them the first week.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \\

		Some of the questions did not align correctly with the material we used in class and it would make more sense to have the weeks correspond to weeks in the quarter. I noticed that some of the questions continued to be posted in week 2 when were in week 4, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \\

		Maybe I missed it, but I thought maybe this was an app? I could've been imagining things, but either way, I think that would be a great extension of the site! Also, I think a good addition might be reminders. Either phone notifications or emails.

		Provide some sort of answer system.
