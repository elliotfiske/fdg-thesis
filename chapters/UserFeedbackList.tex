		\textbf{User Interface Problems} &  - There are some UI problems that could be fixed. Certain values like points and commitment weren't consistent from page to page.\newline-   Solving the can't see answers even if actually trying was kind of frustrating\newline-   I think this might be more useful if there was an app version with a notification each day. I wanted to keep up with Polycommit, but it's pretty easy to forget to check in from day to day. \newline-   Polycommit had one question a day, but the study guide had 70 questions on it. As a result, it wasn't as helpful as I expected it to be because by the time of the exam, I feel like a large portion of the class material didn't show up as a question on polycommit. \newline - Ability to review questions would be nice \newline- Also, explanations for answers would be helpful
