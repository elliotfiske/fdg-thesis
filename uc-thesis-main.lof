\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.2}{\ignorespaces A series of questions as presented by Skinner's teaching machine. The question is ``transformed'' to several different modes that help the user learn the information faster. \relax }}{11}{figure.caption.7}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.3}{\ignorespaces Variable ratio rewards scheduling. Note that as rewards are spaced out randomly, the desired behavior appears much more quickly.\relax }}{11}{figure.caption.9}

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {4.3}{\ignorespaces A diagram explaining how the Cal Poly authentication is handled on the backend. Sites that the user sees in their browser window have a solid outline, and sites that the user does not see are outlined in dotted lines. Similarly, network calls made by the user's computer are represented by a solid arrow, and network calls made by the \textit {Polycommit} backend are represented by a dotted arrow.\relax }}{23}{figure.caption.17}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {4.4}{\ignorespaces The ``Home'' screen for \textit {Polycommit}. Students can see their current progress and can click on a course to answer challenges.\relax }}{30}{figure.caption.18}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {4.5}{\ignorespaces The ``course'' screen for \textit {Polycommit}. Students can see their current points and commitment and can see a list of challenges organized by date.\relax }}{31}{figure.caption.19}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {4.6}{\ignorespaces The ``Challenge'' screen for Polycommit. Students see the content of the challenge and can enter their answers. At the bottom is a link where students can give feedback on a challenge.\relax }}{32}{figure.caption.20}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {4.7}{\ignorespaces The Feedback form for questions. The id for the question is automatically filled in. The student can optionally enter their email address (off-screen) if they want to be contacted when the challenge is fixed.\relax }}{33}{figure.caption.21}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {4.8}{\ignorespaces The view of a challenge once it has been answered incorrectly. The main message assures the user that it still counts for commitment. A full explanation of the problem is under the list of the user's attempts.\relax }}{34}{figure.caption.22}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {4.9}{\ignorespaces Three examples of ``toast'' notifications. These provide useful state-based information, such as whether a challenge was answered correctly. They also can provide feedback if an error occurred, such as a challenge not submitting due to poor network connectivity.\relax }}{35}{figure.caption.23}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {4.10}{\ignorespaces The Postman interface. A series of web requests are sent to the website, and a series of conditions determine whether the tests pass or fail.\relax }}{36}{figure.caption.24}
